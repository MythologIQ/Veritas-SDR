# Changelog

All notable changes to GG-CORE (Greatest Good - Contained Offline Restricted Execution) are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Real ONNX embedding inference (B-ONNX-1, EvolveAI plan-v6.2 Phase 1): `OnnxEmbedder::load(model_dir, model_id, embedding_dim)` loads `<model_dir>/<model_id>/model.onnx` + sibling `tokenizer.json` offline (fail-closed on a missing/invalid model; `new()` remains the not-loaded state and still errors cleanly). The inference pipeline is now tokenize → `simple_eval` → **deterministic** hidden-state selection (`last_hidden_state` | single output | fail loud, mirroring the classifier's `logits` rule — replaces the nondeterministic `HashMap::values().next()`) → **attention-masked mean pooling** → **L2 normalization**. `InferenceInput::TextBatch` now embeds **every** item (previously first-item-only) via the additive `InferenceOutput::EmbeddingBatch(Vec<EmbeddingResult>)`; `Text` still returns `InferenceOutput::Embedding` (EvolveAI adapter source-compatible). `memory_usage()` reports the loaded model's initializer footprint and `unload()` zeroes it. Shared tensor helpers single-sourced in `engine/onnx/tensor_ops.rs` (classifier now imports from there). Tests run against a committed ~1 KB handcrafted ONNX fixture (`core-runtime/tests/fixtures/models/onnx/tiny-embedder/`, generated once by `scripts/gen_onnx_fixture.py` — nothing downloaded at build/test time): golden vector, unit L2 norm, determinism across loads, batch == per-item, fail-loud not-loaded/missing-model/no-feature paths, memory accounting.

### CI / Tooling
- The `advanced` feature is now linted and tested in CI (B-40): added an `advanced` leg to the `rust.yml` `features` matrix (`cargo clippy --features advanced --all-targets -- -D warnings` + `cargo test --features advanced`), closing the gap where advanced-gated code shipped unlinted. Fixed the 14 surfaced clippy lints (`div_ceil`, derivable `Default` on two enums, `map_or`→`is_none_or`, `Vec`-push→`resize`, and `#[allow(clippy::needless_range_loop)]` with justification on the 2-D SIMD quantize kernels where the index drives byte-offset arithmetic). The new leg immediately caught a latent unused-import under `advanced`-without-`gguf`.

### Security
- Added a grounded speculative-decoding security test (B-21d): `speculative_draft_pair_cannot_bypass_model_allowlist` confirms speculation introduces no path-traversal surface — `register_draft_pair` takes model *ids* (not paths) and performs no load, so a traversal-looking draft id is inert; the path allowlist is enforced upstream in `models/loader.rs` at load time (THREAT_MODEL §4.3). Corrected a phantom "THREAT_MODEL §12/§12.2" citation (the doc has §1–8) in the backlog and the speculative security-test header.

### Changed
- Speculative telemetry is now visible in `status` (B-21h): the executor emits the (previously dormant) Prometheus speculative counters each step, and `build_status` derives live speculative stats (draft/accepted/rejected counts, acceptance rate, mean accepted length) from the metrics snapshot the CLI already receives over IPC. Latency / net-speedup / auto-disable are not on the metrics channel and remain a follow-on (a dedicated IPC status field). F-64 added.

### Added
- Speculative KV-cache reuse for the GGUF backend (B-21f): a persistent `GgufSpeculativeSession` (via `self_cell`, owning `Arc<LlamaBackendInner>` + its borrowed `LlamaContext`) decodes the prompt once and, each step, decodes only the committed delta and rolls the speculative draft positions back out of the KV — removing the per-step full-context re-decode that made the wired speculative path net-slower and auto-disable. The session-backed `GgufTargetVerifier` and a new model-free **prompt-lookup draft** (`PromptLookupDraft`, n-gram copy from context) plug into the existing executor; a registered `register_draft_pair` still selects the classic model-based draft. All `#[cfg(feature="advanced")]`(+`gguf`)-gated and off by default. **Correctness is proven token-identical to single-model greedy** (the greedy target accepts a draft token iff it equals the target's argmax, so every committed token is the greedy token) — verified against the local qwen model. **Honest perf caveat**: a wall-clock >1× speedup is a GPU/batch phenomenon and is *not* demonstrable on CPU (a batched decode of _k_ draft tokens costs ≈ _k_× a single token, so speculation cannot win regardless of acceptance rate). On the CPU dev host the speculative path is slower than single-model; the real speedup demonstration is deferred to a GPU benchmark (B-21e). F-62/F-63 added.

### Documentation
- Adopted the canonical `docs/architecture/ADR-007-TIERSYNERGY-ADAPTIVE-SPECULATIVE-DECODING.md` onto `main` (B-21a) — the design of record that five FEATURE_INDEX rows (F-48/49/50/51/53) cited but which existed only on the unmerged PR #59 branch. Reconciled to the built reality: status Proposed → Accepted-implemented-(dormant), with an Implementation Status & Consolidation section recording that the ADR-007 stack (#61–#68, sealed #87–#94) is built + sealed but not yet wired into `Runtime::infer`, and the confirmed v1/v2 → single-`adaptive_speculative` retirement sequence.
- Added `docs/architecture/CORE_RUNTIME_ARCHITECTURE.md` (B-13) — the code-grounded technical spec that `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/TANDEM_EXPERIMENTS_PROPOSAL.md` cited but which did not exist (C.O.R.E. principles, security boundaries, module map, the secure `Runtime::infer` path, GGUF/ONNX dispatch, scheduler/memory, consumable-dependency shape).
- Corrected two mis-stated `docs/FEATURE_INDEX.md` rows (B-14): F-45 (Veritas shim) cited `n/a` despite 14 inline tests — now cited; F-38 (sandbox) marked verified with a unix-gated/CI-verified note. `feature_index_verify` reports 60/60 verified.

### Added
- ONNX inference servable end-to-end: `core_model_load` selects the GGUF or ONNX backend from a sibling `manifest.json` (`load_model_dispatch`); ONNX embed/classify reachable through FFI/Python (closes #72 scope-3).
- Degraded-mode policy: intentional, explained degradation under resource pressure — over-budget prompts are context-reduced instead of hard-failing (closes #53).

### Changed
- Unified GGUF/ONNX behind a single `engine::Model` trait; the registry now holds `Arc<dyn Model>`.
- `sandbox/unix.rs` split for Section 4 Razor (behavior unchanged).

### CI / Tooling
- Added a `bench` CI job (B-34) that runs the CI-safe default-feature benches on every PR to `main`, failing on compile error / bench panic and uploading the criterion baseline — preventing benchmark rot. (It immediately caught a rotted `ipc_throughput` bench → B-39.)
- Added a `security_overhead` bench (B-35) quantifying the per-call `SecurityPipeline` tax every `Runtime::infer` pays: `scan_prompt` ~8.7 ns/byte, `sanitize_output` ~53 ns/byte (the dominant stage), both linear per call. Joins the CI `bench` job. The linear-per-call sanitize result confirms the streaming egress re-sanitize is O(n²) over pushes → B-36 armed.
- Repaired the rotted `ipc_throughput` bench (B-39): `fixture_to_request` now derives the prompt from the fixtures' `prompt_tokens` size ladder instead of a missing top-level `prompt` string, and the bench is re-added to the CI `bench` job (the gate that caught the rot in B-34).
- Added a `scheduler_queue_overhead` bench (B-37) measuring the async `RequestQueue` enqueue/dequeue tax (tokio `Mutex` + `Notify`) over the bare `BinaryHeap`. Result (measurement only, no code change): ~550–620 ns per roundtrip, depth-insensitive, ~250 ns/op amortized under batch drain — <0.1% of per-request inference latency, so the scheduler is confirmed not a hotspot and needs no optimization.

### Added
- **Adaptive speculative decoding is now wired into `Runtime::infer`** (B-21c) — the ADR-007 stack is no longer dormant. A config-gated branch in `InferenceEngine::run` runs a GGUF draft/target speculative decode when `AdaptiveSpeculativeConfig` is active and a draft pair is registered (`register_draft_pair`), otherwise falling through to single-model. Off by default. The security path is unchanged: prompt-injection scan and PII sanitize wrap `run` in the façade, so the speculative branch inherits both; rejected draft suffixes are never committed; a new executor + GGUF adapter + tests (incl. the rejected-suffix-never-committed invariant) back it. All `#[cfg(feature="advanced")]`-gated. NOTE: with the current GGUF backend (fresh context per step, no KV reuse) the wired path is correct but not yet faster (it will auto-disable) — the actual speedup is B-21f (KV-cache reuse).

### Changed (BREAKING, advanced-gated)
- Retired the v1 speculative decoder (`engine/speculative.rs`, B-21b-1). `speculative_v2` is now the single token-level implementation, re-exported under the canonical unsuffixed names `gg_core::engine::{DraftModel, TargetModel, VerifyResult, SpeculativeConfig, SpeculativeDecoder, SpeculativeStats}`; the GGUF adapter + backend were ported to v2's traits. All speculative code is `#[cfg(feature="advanced")]`-gated and dormant (not wired into `Runtime::infer`), so there is no runtime impact; consumers importing `gg_core::engine::speculative::*` (v1) must use the canonical re-exports. First consolidation step of ADR-007 (triple → double); `adaptive_speculative` becomes canonical in B-21c.
- Retired the v2 speculative decoder (`engine/speculative_v2.rs`, B-21b-2), completing ADR-007's double → single consolidation: `adaptive_speculative` (wired in B-21c) is now the sole speculative executor. The v2 token-level decoder (`SpeculativeDecoder` + `DraftModel`/`TargetModel` traits), its GGUF token adapter (`gguf/speculative.rs`, `GgufDraftModel`/`GgufTargetModel`), and their tests were deleted. The shared value types were relocated **verbatim** to a new `gg_core::engine::speculative_types` module and are still re-exported under the canonical unsuffixed names `gg_core::engine::{SpeculativeConfig, SpeculativeStats, VerifyResult}` (behavior of `tier_synergy`, `decode.rs`, and GGUF `verify_draft_tokens` is unchanged); the `DraftModel`/`TargetModel`/`SpeculativeDecoder` re-exports are removed. All `#[cfg(feature="advanced")]`-gated and dormant except the now-canonical adaptive path, so no runtime impact. F-18 removed (subsumed by F-61).

### CI / Tooling (cont.)
- Hardened the perf-regression gate with a ~1µs noise floor (B-34c): sub-microsecond benches (whose CI variance exceeds the 2× threshold) are reported but no longer fail the gate; benches ≥1µs still gate unchanged. Fixes a false-positive flake on `concurrent_resource_ops`.
- Added a run-over-run perf-regression gate (B-34b): the CI `bench` job caches the criterion baseline from `main` and, on each PR, restores it and fails if any tracked bench's median regresses beyond 2.0× (a deliberately generous gross-regression threshold, since the trimmed CI bench run is noisy). No committed absolute baseline (hardware-relative baselines are unsound); the comparison is same-runner-class run-over-run via `core-runtime/scripts/perf_gate.py`. This closes the optimization initiative's measurement + gating work.

### Fixed
- `PromptCache::find_prefix` was O(n²) — it re-hashed every prefix `tokens[..len]` from scratch for each length. It now does a single forward SHA256 pass (cloning the running hasher per prefix), making longest-prefix lookup O(n) with identical results (B-38). Confirmed by the new `prompt_cache_overhead` bench (flat throughput across 64/512/2048 tokens). The prompt cache is dormant (not yet wired into inference), so this removes a latent trap before it ships.

### Performance
- Streaming egress PII sanitizer is now O(n) per stream instead of O(n²) (B-36). Previously every generated token re-sanitized the entire accumulated buffer; it now caches the sanitized stable prefix and re-sanitizes only a bounded tail, rebasing the prefix at boundaries proven to split no PII match. Output is byte-identical to the previous whole-buffer sanitize (verified by a differential test against a whole-buffer reference + a one-shot oracle), and the release decision stays on sanitized text so internal-separator PII (e.g. credit-card numbers) is never split and leaked.

### Security / **BREAKING**
- **`Runtime::infer`/`infer_stream` is now the sole external inference entry point.** `InferenceEngine::{run, run_cancellable, run_cancellable_with_memory_limit, run_stream_sync}` are `pub(crate)` — a consumer can no longer bypass the `SecurityPipeline` (ingress scan + egress PII sanitize). Embedded consumers that called the raw engine must switch to `runtime.infer()` (see COREFORGE #538). `InferenceEngine`/`new` remain public.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-07-27

### Security & Dependency Hardening

Consolidates the security-chain wiring, the unified secure inference façade, the
CI feature matrix, and the dependency-advisory cleanup accumulated since 0.8.1
(PRs #71–#79). No breaking public API change.

#### Security

- **Security pipeline wired into production** (`src/security/pipeline.rs`, PR #73):
  ingress prompt-injection scan + egress PII sanitization now run on the live
  inference path instead of existing only in tests.
- **Unified secure inference façade** (`src/runtime_facade.rs`, PR #75):
  `Runtime::infer` / `infer_stream` route both the embedded (COREFORGE) and the
  consumable (FFI/Python) surfaces through the same scan → engine → sanitize path;
  fixed an FFI/Python enqueue-with-no-worker deadlock.

#### Dependencies (advisory cleanup)

- **pyo3 0.21 → 0.29** (PR #78): clears RUSTSEC-2026-0176 (high), RUSTSEC-2026-0177
  (medium), RUSTSEC-2025-0020 (low); `pyo3-asyncio-0-21` → `pyo3-async-runtimes`.
- **rand 0.8 → 0.9** (PR #79): final Dependabot item; `OsRng` migrated to the
  `TryRngCore::unwrap_err()` adapter, preserving CSPRNG + panic-on-entropy-failure
  semantics on the key/nonce generation path.
- **Dropped `atty`** (PR #76): `cbindgen` 0.26 → 0.28 removes the unmaintained
  `atty` build-time dependency (RUSTSEC-2024-0375/0378).

#### Added

- **Real ONNX classifier** (`src/engine/onnx/classifier.rs`, PR #77): candle-onnx
  `simple_eval` classifier with a pure `logits_to_classification` (softmax+argmax)
  helper and deterministic output selection.
- **CI feature matrix** (`.github/workflows/rust.yml`, PR #71): dedicated
  `features` legs building `gguf` / `onnx` / `ffi` / `python`, flushing out latent
  per-feature clippy/compile debt on the CI-invisible surfaces.

#### Verified

- ✅ Full matrix green under `-D warnings`: fmt + clippy + test across 3 OS, plus
  the gguf/onnx/ffi/python feature legs, CodeQL, and Analyze.
- ✅ All Dependabot advisories cleared as of this release.

  - `e2e_chat_messages`: Chat message formatting with system/user roles
  - `e2e_speculative_decoding`: Speculative decoding integration test
  - `e2e_performance_benchmark`: Throughput measurement (tok/s)

- ✅ Batch generation (~40 tok/s on CPU release, ~21 tok/s debug)
- ✅ Streaming generation (20 tokens via async channel)
- ✅ Chat messages with role formatting
- ✅ Flash Attention enabled automatically
- ✅ Memory usage: 435 MiB model + 299 MiB compute + 6 MiB KV cache

## [0.6.7] - 2026-02-19

### Production Safety Fixes

This release focuses on production safety and fail-fast behavior for the COREFORGE integration.

#### Fixed

- **Flash Attention Placeholder**: CUDA and Metal implementations now return explicit errors instead of zero vectors when kernel not implemented
- **Tokenizer Stub Behavior**: `encode()` and `decode()` now return `TokenizerError::NotLoaded` instead of silently returning empty results

- **Benchmark Protocol**: Updated IPC throughput and scheduler benchmarks to use v0.6.5 text-based protocol

#### Added

- `InferenceEngine::get_handle()` method for model_id to ModelHandle resolution
- 8 new tests for InferenceEngine and InferenceParams validation
- Explicit version roadmap comments for unimplemented status --json fields (v0.7.0+)
